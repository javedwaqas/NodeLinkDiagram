Computational:
[ ] Store (light-weight) aggregation hierarchy to allow for quick rebuilding
[X] Freeze/thaw for aggregate graph updates
[X] Provide support for performing a single step of aggregation
[X] Store aggregation hierarchy and/or pairwise node distances
[X] Midpoint distance function
[X] Separate distance function from aggregation algorithm
[X] Hierarchical/agglomerative aggregation for nodes

Visual representation:
[ ] Edge bundling to cope with aggregated nodes
[ ] Calculate overlap in image (check for intersection of Java shapes in scene graph)
[ ] Calculate density in image (number of items per screen pixel units)
[ ] Implement additional graph layout algorithms that fit our study better
[ ] Translucency in hull (make it more subtle)
[X] Edges working with the aggregated nodes
[X] Convex hull representations of aggregated nodes

Architectural:
[ ] Incremental updates of the aggregated node link canvas
[ ] User study platform interface
[X] Java WebStart version 
[X] Visual representation listens to the aggregate graph 
[X] Create separate balanced and unbalanced aggregate graph structures 
[X] Aggregated graph data structure

Interaction:
[ ] Highlight nodes and connected edges (and nodes?) on mouse over
[X] Allow for numeric keys to control percentages of total number of nodes visible
[X] Lasso selection for merging
[X] Roll-up/Drill-down using mouse wheel (next node to merge/split)
[X] Roll-up/Drill-down interaction with the aggregated nodes (click to roll/drill)

Bugs:
[ ] Multiple self-edges when splitting merged nodes
[X] Incorrect edges when manually aggregating (due to aggregation not updating supernode neighbors)
[X] Concurrent modification problem when changing aggregation (thread-safety, use properties for updates)
[X] Manage unbalanced split/merge in the aggregated graph 
[X] Some edges remain after fully aggregating the graph for the insitu GraphML file
